# DDoS Attack Detection Using Autoencoder
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is a type of cyber-attack that is frequently used against public servers. DDoS attack detection systems are critical in preventing security threats and defending networks. Despite the fact that many distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack detection algorithms have been proposed DDoS attacks remain a major problem. To address the issues, we proposed an Autoencoder-based DDoS Detection Framework, which bases the detection model solely on normal traffic. Finally, using extracted features, the model performance in balanced and imbalanced data instances is evaluated. We evaluate our model using the newly released dataset CICDDoS2019, which contains a wide range of DDoS attacks and fills gaps in existing datasets. Experiment results on the CICDDoS2019 datasets show that our proposed solution not only achieves 99% detection rate but also achieves low false positive rate (FPR).
